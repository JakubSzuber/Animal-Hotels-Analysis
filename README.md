# Animal-Hotels-Analysis

## About project
This is a project which contains bunch of SQL queries to analyze several tables in the postgres database which I used to select varietly information about animals (databse imitating real vorld tiny databse of the animal hotels). My goal while creating it was to use as many postgreSQL types of queries and its features as it's posiible. Two main tables was based on datasets from https://data.world/datasets/animals but they required a lot additing in exel to be enough expanded to use most important queries on them. Database which I worked with has 5 tables, 2 of them have plenty columns with most significant information about aniamals and their owners, they are diffrent to each other (form of storing data is diffrent and diffrent information is stored in tables). Other 3 tables are much smaller, they contains informatin about: rooms in hotels, animal species, animal breeds.

## What I learned
-How to finding datasets in intnernet and modify them with Exel to the form which is ready to import to postgres

-How to import csv files into postgres as whole new tables
